	<h3>Education</h3>

	<button class="accordion" class="btn btn-default btn-sm">

	</button>
	<div class="panel">
	<p>
	Program Description:
	<br>
	Computer Engineering is one of the newest areas of engineering, a dynamic field that thrives on innovation and challenges. Business, industry, and home applications create the need for products that often can be used both for work as well as for entertainment. In the high technology areas of the United States, Sacramento included, Computer Engineering has experienced tremendous growth, becoming one of the major driving forces behind the rapidly advancing electronics and computer industry. Employment projections consistently predict that computer engineering and computer science will continue to experience more than a doubling of growth in a ten-year period.
	<br>
	<br>
	Nationally, nearly all engineering universities offer a degree in Computer Engineering. Being close in course content to Electrical Engineering and to Computer Science, these degrees are found in various departmental and program configurations. At Sacramento State, Computer Engineering enjoys the advantage of both areas since it is a program jointly supported by the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department and the Computer Science Department.
	<br>
	<br>
	Lower division preparation in Computer Engineering parallels that of Computer Science, with the addition of a basic electrical circuit course and a logic design course. Except for the logic design course, most community colleges offer sufficient lower division courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and most importantly, computer science.
